## Data
https://www.kaggle.com/ploverbrown/world-bank-indicators-collection

https://www.kaggle.com/sevgisarac/temperature-change

## (Explanation of Data: Include subject, size, variables ect...)
# Dataset 1 
-Subject: Dataset with indicators of world countries.

# Dataset 2
-Subject: Temperature change of different countries

## (Importance of data: Include the goal of the project and its real world aplications).
# To be able to predict the global warming by indicators of countries
- Infrastructure
- Economic Growth
- Trade
- Poverty
## Benchmark
## (Explain any similar projects that already exist, as well as ways they differ from your project) Existing projects include:
## Sample1
https://www.kaggle.com/ghenima/temperature-change-analysis-in-progress
# This person did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use the indicators of different countires to predict the temperature change for individual countries

## Sample2
https://www.kaggle.com/gatandubuc/forecast-with-n-beats-interpretable-model
# This person also did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use neural networks to make a better forecast for global warming across all countries globally

## Proposed Model/Algorithm
# We will combine 2 datasets. One for indicator of countries, other one for temperature change. 

## (Create a diagram to demonstrate how the project code works)
