## [Insert Project Topic Name]

## Vincent Li, Innokentiy Kaurov, Henry Greenhut, Oliver Zhou, Krishna Suresh

## Data
[Dataset with indicators of world countries](https://www.kaggle.com/ploverbrown/world-bank-indicators-collection)

[Dataset with temperature changes of different countries](https://www.kaggle.com/sevgisarac/temperature-change)

## Importance of data
### To be able to predict the global (and domestic!) warming by the following indicators:
- Infrastructure
- Economic Growth
- Trade
- Poverty
## Benchmark. Existing projects include:
## Sample 1[https://www.kaggle.com/ghenima/temperature-change-analysis-in-progress]
This person did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use the indicators of different countires to predict the temperature change for individual countries

## Sample 2[https://www.kaggle.com/gatandubuc/forecast-with-n-beats-interpretable-model]
This person also did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use neural networks to make a better forecast for global warming across all countries globally

## Proposed Model/Algorithm
We will combine 2 datasets. One for indicator of countries, other one for temperature change.
