# Prediction of Global Warming through Analysis of Countries' Development Indicators

## Vincent Li, Innokentiy Kaurov, Henry Greenhut, Oliver Zhou, Krishna Suresh

## Data
[Dataset with indicators of world countries](https://www.kaggle.com/ploverbrown/world-bank-indicators-collection)

[Dataset with temperature changes of world countries](https://www.kaggle.com/sevgisarac/temperature-change)

## Importance of data
### To be able to predict the global (and domestic!) warming by the following indicators:
- Infrastructure
- Economic Growth
- Trade
- Poverty
## Benchmark. Existing projects include:
## [Sample 1](https://www.kaggle.com/ghenima/temperature-change-analysis-in-progress)
This person did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use the countries indicators to predict the temperature change in individual areas.

## [Sample 2](https://www.kaggle.com/gatandubuc/forecast-with-n-beats-interpretable-model)
This person also did a forecast of temperature. We are going to use neural networks to make more accurate forecasts of global warming.
## Proposed Model/Algorithm
Our aim is to combine the 2 datasets mentioned above...

## Diagram: coming soon...
